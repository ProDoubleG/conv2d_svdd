# conv2d_svdd
## SVDD performance test on MNIST

### black dots are considered abnormal and green dots are normal
### blue dots are test sets.
### If test label is different with normal label, blue dots should be away from green dots

## it seemed to work on letters that are easily distinguishable like 0,8 and 7

## Also showed somewhat accurate distribution on test label:7

## However, it had low accuracy on 1 and 9 which are quite similar with letter 7

## Conclusuon : raw Conv2d application on svdd does not guarantee convincing result. It needs different approch
